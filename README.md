## [AAAI 2025] Disentangling Tabular Data Towards Better One-Class Anomaly Detection
## Environments
We run our code on RTX3090 with Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.13.0.
## Dataset Preparation
Download tabular datasets from [ODDS](https://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/) and [ADBench](https://github.com/Minqi824/ADBench). Move the data into ``./data_preprocess/data``.
## Run
Run ``train.py`` to start training and evaluation.
